#Front End Test General Questions
1. What is your preferred development environment(OS, Editor or IDE, Browsers, Tools etc.)?
  * OS: OS X
  * Editor: Vim and/or Sublime, if too much Javascript is involved, I'd like to employ WebStorm
  * Browsers: Chrome
  * Tools: Emmet(zen coding), Chrome developer tools

2. How would you approach optimizing a website's perceived or actual load time?
  * SDN for images, css and javascripts
  * Using ajax for dynamic loading data
  * Compress css and javascript files
  * Be careful about javascript libraries (cut down unused features in popular libraries)

3. What CSS frameworks have you used, which do you prefer, and why?
  * I've used Bootstrap, jQuery UI and Dojo
  * I prefer Bootstrap, because it's more pure css framework and more beautiful
  
4. If you could master one technology this year, what would it be (and why)?
  * If I can have only one option, it would be AngularJS.
  * It's just cool.

5. How do you organize/structure your CSS files?
  * First of all, use a framework, and put them together
  * Secondly, have a css for the layout and common parts of the website
  * Next, have specific css files for each inner parts of the website
  * Finally, have specific css files for each javascript plugin

  * If I'm gonna construct a website that supports changing themes, it would be more complex than the above solution
